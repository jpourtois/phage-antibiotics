# phage-antibiotics

This repositery contains all code written for "Filamentous bacteriophages and the competitive interaction between Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains under antibiotic treatment: a modelling study" 

### There are seven main files, which run the analysis and generate all figures in the paper (Figure 1-6) and Supplementary Material (Figure S1)

The code for Figure 5 and 6 can take a more than an hour to run on a laptop. 
  
### In order to run the analysis, the additional files are required in the same folder:
  
  'compareRegimens.m'
  
  'EmaxcompareNoResist.m'
  
  'competeRegimens.m'
  
  'EmaxcompeteNoResist.m' 
  
  'fc_var_par_median.m'
  
  'PRCC_function.m'
